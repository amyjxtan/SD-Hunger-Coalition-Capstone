# Forecasting Nutrition Support: Reducing Meal Gap Delays with Predictive Analytics

### By Adeline Liem, Amy Tan, and Shirley Agustin

**About**

Our project, conducted in collaboration with the San Diego Hunger Coalition, develops data-driven machine learning models to forecast need for food assistance programs, such as the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, as well as CalFresh. Additionally, by combining public program datasets with economic indicators, we were able to define an updated FPL (Federal Poverty Line) to identify households experiencing nutrition insecurity in San Diego. These tools allow us to address San Diego Hunger Coalition's four-month reporting lag for food assistance data, enabling more timely and accurate predictions of program participation. This ultimately helps ensure that vulnerable populations across San Diego receive the nutritional support they need.

The project deliverable can be found in `sdhc_css_capstone.ipynb`.
